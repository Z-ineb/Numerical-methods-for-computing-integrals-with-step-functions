Step functions provide a method to estimate integrals by dividing the integration interval into smaller segments. Within each segment, 
the function is approximated as a constant, forming the step function. This simplification allows for straightforward calculation of the integral within each segment,
as it involves multiplying the constant function value by the width of the segment.

In our code we're going to implement 3 methods: 
<br>
  -Midpoint rule
<br>
  -Trapezoidal rule
<br>
  -Simpson's rule
